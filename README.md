# CellBlender_Models
## Repository for CellBlender Models and Examples

This repository should contain JSON text files which encapsulate a complete CellBlender model.
Models should be either grouped into their own subdirectory or added to the "Assorted" subdirectory.
These are the current model categories:

* **[Assorted](Assorted)**
* **[Lotka Volterra Models](Lotka_Volterra)**

To run these models:

* Download and save the JSON text file on local storage.
* Initialize CellBlender (as needed).
* File / Import / CellBlender Model and Geometry (JSON)
* Save as a new Blender file (.blend) where simulation will run.
* Export and Run.
* Reload Visualization Data.
* Zoom with scroll wheel as needed to see model.
* Use "VCR Controls" to play back simulation.
* Explore, modify, and rerun as desired.
