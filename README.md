# CellBlender_Models
## Repository for CellBlender Models and Examples

This repository contains JSON text files which encapsulate complete CellBlender models.
Models are either grouped into their own subdirectory or added to the "Assorted" subdirectory.
These are the current model categories:

* **[Assorted Models](Assorted)**
* **[Lotka Volterra Models](Lotka_Volterra)**

To run these models:

* Download and save the JSON text file on local storage.
* Initialize CellBlender (as needed).
* File / Import / CellBlender Model and Geometry (JSON)
* Save as a new Blender file (.blend) where simulation will run.
* Export and Run.
* Reload Visualization Data.
* Zoom with scroll wheel as needed to see model.
* Use "VCR Controls" to play back simulation.
* Explore, modify, and rerun as desired.
